#
# This configuration file binds many of the common GNU screen key bindings to
# appropriate tmux key bindings. Note that for some key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue and also that this set omits binding some commands available in
# tmux but not in screen.
#
# Note this is a good starting point but you should check out the man page for more
# configuration options if you really want to get more out of tmux
 
### Unbind existing tmux key bindings (except 0-9).

#averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes. They are the same as the load average
#numbers given by uptime(1) and other programs. The fourth field consists of
#two numbers separated by a slash (/). The first of these is the number of
#currently executing kernel scheduling entities (processes, threads); this
#will be less than or equal to the number of CPUs. The value after the slash
#is the number of kernel scheduling entities that currently exist on the 
#system. The fifth field is the PID of the process that was most recently
#created on the system.
